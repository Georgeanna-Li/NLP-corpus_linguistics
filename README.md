# NLP-corpus_linguistics
1. linguistics_corpus_basics: Processing and basic analysis of natural language datasets (corpora) using the Python programming language
   - Understand the basic properties of corpora used in computational linguistics including typical annotations for those corpora
   - Manipulate strings corresponding to human language and identify linguistic features using build-in Python string libraries
   - Compare corpora (and sub corpora) based on corpus statistics
   - Preprocess raw and structured text into appropriate Python data structures using relevant tools

2. computational_semantics: An overview of popular semantic resources, and techniques for building new resources from unstructured text data. 
   - Access major lexical semantic resources and apply them to relevant tasks in computational lingusitics
   - Translate simple sentences into first order logic formulas and carry out inference
   - Build distributional models of word meaning from corpora
   - Define various kinds of discourse coherence and know how they can be represented computationally
