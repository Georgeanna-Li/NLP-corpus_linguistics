# NLP-corpus_linguistics
## 1. linguistics_corpus_basics: 
Processing and basic analysis of natural language datasets (corpora) using the Python programming language
   - Understand the basic properties of corpora used in computational linguistics including typical annotations for those corpora
   - Manipulate strings corresponding to human language and identify linguistic features using build-in Python string libraries
   - Compare corpora (and sub corpora) based on corpus statistics
   - Preprocess raw and structured text into appropriate Python data structures using relevant tools

## 2. computational_semantics: 
An overview of popular semantic resources, and techniques for building new resources from unstructured text data. 
   - Access major lexical semantic resources and apply them to relevant tasks in computational lingusitics
   - Translate simple sentences into first order logic formulas and carry out inference
   - Build distributional models of word meaning from corpora
   - Define various kinds of discourse coherence and know how they can be represented computationally

## 3. parsing_linguistics:
Syntactic corpora, popular grammar formalisms and associated parsing tools and algorithms for determining the syntactic structure of natural language

   - Identify plausible phrases and larger syntactic structure in English sentences
   - Extract syntactic features from trees derived from treebanks and popular off-the-shelf parsers
   - Provide the steps of several major parsing algorithms and implement key aspects of these algorithms
   - Use statistics to disambiguate language to find the best parse
   - Evaluate parsing output relative to gold standard treebanks

## 4. sentiment_analysis:

   - Apply appropriate resources when carrying out lexicon-based polarity classification
   - Identify challenges and potential solutions associated with identifying sentiment targets
   - Carry out fine-grained sentiment analysis with large datasets using appropriate machine learning techniques
   - Track sentiment over time, space, and topic using social media datasets

* `tree_syntax.pdf` is a very useful learning material when it comes to remember what the syntax actually means in a parse tree.
